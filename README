I. INTRO
It's a great recipe for a steak-hache milkshake.
Who doesn't love steak-hache?!
We all love steak-hache.
We all love milkshakes too.
Steak-Hache + milkshake == twice the love!
Make a Steak-HacheShake. Thank me later.

II. REQUIREMENTS
Unless you have an enormous mortar & pestle, you're going to need a blender.
Scratch that, you *need* a blender. A good one.
We used one with a spout, those things are the bomb.

That's really all you need.

Don't forget to seal everything. As delicious as Steak-HacheShake is, if the Blender explodes, it's still gonna be nasty to clean up.

III. HOW TO
Follow the recipe.
Mix all the stuff in the blender.
Drink it.
(No, it's not "brotein"; girls like Steak-HacheShakes, too.)
