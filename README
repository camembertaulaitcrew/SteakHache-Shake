I. INTRO
It's a great recipe for a bacon milkshake.
Who doesn't love bacon?!
We all love bacon.
We all love milkshakes too.
Bacon + milkshake == twice the love! 
Make a BaconShake. Thank me later.

II. REQUIREMENTS
Unless you have an enormous mortar & pestle, you're going to need a blender.
Scratch that, you *need* a blender. A good one.
We used one with a spout, those things are the bomb.

That's really all you need. 

Don't forget to seal everything. As delicious as BaconShake is, if the Blender explodes, it's still gonna be nasty to clean up.

III. HOW TO
Follow the recipe.
Mix all the stuff in the blender. 
Drink it. 
(No, it's not "brotein"; girls like BaconShakes, too.)
